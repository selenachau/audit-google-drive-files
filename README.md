# audit-google-drive-files
get a list of owners and permissions on files and folders from a personal Google Drive Account

For individuals that collaborate in groups with rotating membership, this audit list can help identify which files are owned by expired or old  members, and to make copies of files before they are inaccessible.

Two scripts were added to Google Apps Scripts, one from https://gist.github.com/mesgarpour/07317e81e9ee2b3f1699 to create the list and one from https://support.google.com/docs/thread/173106523/can-i-export-a-list-of-users-who-have-been-given-access-to-one-of-my-google-sheets?hl=en to pull the owners, editors, and viewers for each file and folder.
